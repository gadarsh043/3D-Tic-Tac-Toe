        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>3D Tic-Tac-Toe is played on a 3x3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) in an empty cell.</p>
        <p>The goal is to get three of your symbols in a row, which can be:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Horizontal (in a single layer)</li>
          <li>Vertical (in a single layer)</li>
          <li>Across layers (same row and column, different layers)</li>
          <li>Diagonally (within a layer or across layers)</li>
        </ul>
      </Section>
      <Section>
        <h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
        <p>- Focus on the center of each layer to control more winning lines.</p>
        <p>- Block your opponentâ€™s potential winning lines while setting up your own.</p>
        <p>- Think in 3D: diagonals across layers are often overlooked!</p>

        <h2>Winning Conditions</h2>
        <p>A player wins by getting three symbols in a row in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, including 3D diagonals across layers.</p>
